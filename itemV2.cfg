Any suggestions for things to implement, please post down in the comments.
I will continually update this mod and hopefully it can be sanctioned.
Any Non-Custom settings will carry over to the official realm. See at the bottom which ones are custom.

[h1]Currently Implemented:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Stationary Dodge: You can now dodge backwards, when you are not moving and press the dodge key.
[*] Stationary Dodge on Jump/Dodge Key: Toggles whether the Jump/Dodge key activates stationary dodge.
[*] Ingame Tutorials: Enables/Disable Tutorial pop ups.
[*] Maximum Shadow Casting Lights: Decreased Minimum to 0. (from 1)
[*] LOD Quality: Sets distance to which LOD objects appear. (Only Low or High)
[*] Decoration Density: Can exactly tell what's this does.
[*] SFX Volume: Need you guys to report this as I am unsure exactly what this does. So far
[list]
[*] Menu SFXs such as Vaults, Okri Challenges and the end loot screen.
[/list] 
[*] VO Volume: Need you guys to report this as I am unsure exactly what this does. So far
[*] Controller:
[list]
[*] Layout: Now provides multiple layouts for both controllers. (There is a Alternate 4 but it crashes the game ATM)
[*] Enable Left Hand Mod (WIP): Enables the left handed control layout. (There is text errors on the controller layout and I most likely have to remap some actions)
[*] Rumble: Enables Rumble. Note: Had to code this in myself as FS removed the code for rumble so it's not exactly like it is on Xbox/PS4.
[/list] 
[/list] 

[h1]Planned Implementation:[/h1]
[list]
[*] Local Light Shadow Quality Atlas Size
[*] Local Light Shadow Quality Filter (Splitting up this and above for possible performance increase)
[*] Sun Shadow Quality Atlas Size
[*] Sun Shadow Quality Filter (Splitting up this and above for possible performance increase)
[*] Process Priority: Set's CPU process priority automatically.
[*] Use Baked Enemy Meshes: Uses baked enemy meshes (possible performance increase)
[*] Twitch Difficulty: Set the twitch difficulty.
[*] LOD Quality: Find proper tooltip so it is displayed properly.
[*] Ingame Language Changing: Need to look into this more, should technically work but unsure.
[*] Matchmaking Region: Possible implementation, but I believe it might be PS4 only.
[*] Controller:
[list]
[*] Layout: Fix Alternate 4 and possibly add custom layouts.
[*] Safe Zone: Possible create a safe zone, so the game displays proper on a TV. Unsure if this is needed.
[*] Rumble Intensity.
[*] Dead Zones + other controller things I can modify.

[h1]Custom:[/h1]
